Part 6: Developing Skills is not finished \n
Many of the core features of these characters are now implemented, but the adventurers cannot  really do much yet. The only action (method) they have is scout().
Create an additional method, duel(), for the Adventurer class with the following functionality:
Accept an Adventurer as a parameter.
Use the roll() functionality to create opposing rolls for each adventurer.
Subtract 1 from the adventurer with the lower roll.
Log the results of this “round” of the duel, including the rolls and current health values.
Repeat this process until one of the two adventurers reaches 50 health.
Log the winner of the duel: the adventurer still above 50 health.
What other properties and methods could these classes have? Should fighters, healers, and wizards have their own methods? Should companions have specific methods?
Feel free to experiment with your own ideas, be they silly or practical. The goal of this exercise is to develop new skills for the characters and yourself! Express your creativity.
